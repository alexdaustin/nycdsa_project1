Submitted in fulfillment of the Python Data Analysis Project.

At time of submission, in addition to this Readme the GitHub repository should
hold a Jupyter Notebook comtaining the Python code used to perform the analysis
and create the plots, and the slides for a talk to be given. Those files are
hospitals_eda.ipynb and hospitals_slides.pdf respectively.

The data used for this project is publicly available at
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/search?theme=Hospitals
In particular I made use of the datasets
'Unplanned Hospital Visits - Hospital' (Unplanned_Hospital_Visits-Hospital.csv),
'Patient survey (HCAHPS) - Hospital' (HCAHPS-Hospital.csv), and
'Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program' (FY_2021_HAC_Reduction_Program_Hospital.csv).
These datasets are periodically updated. It is likely our analysis would continue
to work following an update (unless the number or name of columns is changed).
The data we used were those available at 7/20/2021. If someone wanted to recreate
the exact results those are available upon request.
